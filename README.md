# Rick & Morty API

# Project Description.
 This is an application that generates characters from the Rick and Morty show by fetching data from a [public API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character). The user can also search for characters in the show using the search button.

# Challenges faced.
The main challenge was finding the right public API to implement onto the project. Most public APIs have a [CORS(Cross-origin resource sharing)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) security feature that restricts HTTP requests that are initiated from scripts running in the browser, thus making it impossible to use some of the APIs.


# How to install and run the project.
To fetch data from our API in this lab, you are required to fetch data from the [Rick & Morty public API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character).
To filter characters, use the following API endpoint: [Filter characters(https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/?name)]

## User story:
